### list of utilities :

    -verif-snap.ksh         : list the outputs in CONFCASE-S directory
                              verification on consistency of file sizes

    -verif-mean.ksh         : same for the means

    -verif-computations.ksh : verify from iweight in means files
                              that the correct numbers of files have
                              been used (5d outputs, no-leap)

    -monthlymean.ksh        : compute a single monthly mean

    -annualmean.ksh         : compute a single annual mean

    -dmon_cortime.f90       : fortran program used for correction of time in mean field of old-fashoned runs. 
                              set correct value to time_counter, adjust time_counter attributes and set global attribute.
                              After this processing, -MEAN files can be processed by monitoring, and results will be compatible
                              with recent runs.  It is advisable to save the processed file in place of old-fashoned ones.
