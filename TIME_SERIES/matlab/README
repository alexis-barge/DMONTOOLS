This is the package for matlab plot of the Drakakr Monitoring System. It mainly produces time-series.
  * In SINGLE programs are used for a single config-case, and all is wrapped in the shell script monitor.csh which is invoked with the config-case name :
      e.g : monitor.csh ORCA025-B83 : It produces the time series as choosen in the MONITOR.m main program.

  * In COMPARE, programs are used to  compare up to 4 different config case.  The shell scripts are respectively
      c-monitor.csh : 2 config
      c-monitor3.csh : 3 config
      c-monitor4.csh : 4 config
   The respective main programs, where to choose the plots are CMONITOR.m CMONITOR3.m ans CMONITOR4.m
     The shell script are invoked with as the config case names as argument, eventually followed by the number of day since the begining that we want to
     be plotted. If not specified, the time axis cover the largest config-case. Additionally, we assume that climatological run starts before 1900 (typically
     starting y0001) and when comparing to interannual, a shift in the initial date is done for synchronisation of the runs.

     e.g: c-monitor3.csh ORCA025-B83 ORCA025-G70 ORCA025-MJM01 50 
         (50 indicates we just want the 50 first years, otherwise, the 310 years are plotted).
